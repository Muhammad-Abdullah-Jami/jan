# I am working on a chatbot (voice bot)from scratch
--How it was made
  1. First i made a simple two way response.
       a. It gets user voice and convert it into pcm16 format for OpenAI
       b. It sends that pcm16 format to OpenAI using the API-key and gets the responce
       c. then it converts that pcm16 response to normal format and reply aloud
       (this whole process takes a very much long time to respond so it needed imporvement)
  2. Researching......
  3.
